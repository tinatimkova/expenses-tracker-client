## Wireframes and user stories

### User stories
1. As a user, I would like to be able to sign up and sign in using email and a password.
2. An authorized user should be able to see the list of expenses (categories).
3. As an authorized user I want to be able to click on individual category and see all transactions that belong to it.
4. As an authorized user I'd like to be able to delete or edit transactions.
5. As an authorized user I can add new transactions to existing categories of expenses.
6. As an authorized user I'd love to be able to change password.
